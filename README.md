# Python_start
What i started with
1) Folder 00 contains the code that gives a response to a command line like "cat data_hashes_10lines.txt | python blocks.py 10". The file specified in the command line contains hash lines. The code 
   gives out only those lines that start with 5 zeros and it stops when it has processed 10 lines in the file.
2) Folder 01 contains the code that works with string lines taking the first letter of each word of a line coming in the command line.
3) Folder 02 contains the code that works with .txt files gives True if the 2d image in the file contains letter "M", and False if it does not.
